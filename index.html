                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                        My journey began at Baruch College in New York, where I completed my bachelor's degree in biology. My academic background provided me with a strong foundation in 
                        scientific principles and analytical thinking. As I explored my interests, I discovered a deep passion for software development and the opportunity it offered to 
                        creatively solve complex problems. This realization led me to transition into the field of computer science, where I found fulfillment in building innovative 
                        solutions and collaborating with others.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        In 2022, I began my master's program at Grand Canyon University, specializing in software development. This program allowed me to hone my skills in various aspects
                        of the field and stay current with emerging trends and technologies. My technical expertise spans multiple languages and frameworks, including Python, Java, and HTML/CSS, 
                        and I'm always open to learning new ones to expand my capabilities.
                        I have a keen interest in full stack development, database management, and machine learning. These areas offer exciting opportunities for growth and innovation, 
                        and I strive to stay at the forefront of advancements in these fields.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Interests</h4>
                    <p>
                        Outside of software, my interests include playing golf and chess, which challenge my strategic thinking and precision. I enjoy practicing piano, as it is both expressive 
                        and relaxing. Reading a good book is a great way for me to expand my knowledge and immerse myself in new perspectives. 
                        I also love exploring new places, whether it's a bustling city or a peaceful countryside, as it fuels my curiosity and appreciation for diverse cultures. 
                        Lastly, I have a passion for lifelong learning, constantly seeking out opportunities to acquire new skills and insights in various fields.
